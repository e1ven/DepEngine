This is a small little "Dependency Engine", allow you to schedule jobs to run at any point in the future.
It will check to see that any pre-reqs of that job are satisfied before firing.

An example use case might be scheduling a tape backup:
	You don't want to write the tape until all your Rsync's finish.
	You don't want any rsync to start until after midnight.

No problem. Assign a dependency of Hour 1-11 on the rsync jobs, and make those a dependency of the tapewrite.

Files are as follows-
	filename.sh :: Your script
	filename.sh.deps :: A list of files that should be run. These can include command line variables.
